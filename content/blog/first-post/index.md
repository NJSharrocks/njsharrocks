I used to enjoy writing. Stories, poetry, articles...anything really. But like a lot of things it's been lost with the chaos of life. Three years ago I headed back to university to study a Web Design and Development BSc degree, which I graduated from this week with a first. I continue with a Masters of Research course starting in October, once again at Edge Hill University in Ormskirk. So I guess this is a perfect time to pick up writing again? Maybe?

I'm not sure what this will become yet. I'm not even sure how often it'll be updated, or what focus each post will take. All I know is that I'll be putting some thoughts down on paper (well, not actual paper) every now and then, mostly about tech or conservation issues probably.
